TIMED QUIZ PROJECT

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the Start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

This project was created to address the above user requirements. The quiz has 10 questions which it cycles through at random. When user clicks on answer, 
the answer field is highlight in red or green to display if it is correct. Once the user has completed all 10 questions, they are taken to the gameover page where they can 
input their name and save their high score. The applications stores a maximum of 10 highscores, after which it eliminates the lower scores.
